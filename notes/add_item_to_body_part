Add item to body part

April 10, 2016

Just reviewed this.

If you say “add character sword hand"
1) lookup the pid of "sword" and resend as {add, Char, SwordPid, <<“hand”>>}
2) lookup the pid of “hand” and resend as {add, SwordPid, HandPid}
3) Check that a sword can be added to a hand
     Ew, uses a gen_server call to get the body parts compatible with the item.
I need to fix this.
