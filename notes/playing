Playing

Feb 4, 2019

I can:
connect to the mud
connect the log page to the mud
move from room to room
look at the room and at objects
I can see exits now when I look

  I need to create a new event that finds the players room when they login and then moves  them to that room. When the player logs in I have no idea what room they are in and I don’t  want the connection object asking the player object anything.

  I’m getting back into this and I’m trying to play the mud.
  I’ve got the server started (which starts the web server) and I’ve attached the browser to it.
  - I changed the websocket to 8081 and added it to sys.config
  - 8080 is being used by my budget application
  - I don’t want to have to hard-code the port, however the web page is still      hard-coded
  I added an export to the ./r script so that the erlmud_event_log will log there instead of the   current working directory, which for a release is _rel/erlmud/
  I’m using erlmud_world.erl to initialize the world but when I do “look” I don’t seem to  get any response. So, I’m working through how to look at the room or a player.
  I did “look Bob”, which is the player name in erlmud_test_worlds.hrl, but I get nothing.
  What are the handlers listed in the event log?
  Ah, that’s just part of the properties of the object calling into erlmud_event_log,
  so it’s probably erlmud_conn because the handlers are:
  erlmud_handler_conn_enter_world
  erlmud_handler_conn_send
  Where do those get added?
  Ah, erlmud_conn adds them
  I think erlmud_conn creates a new erlmud_object that is a proxy for the erlmud_conn
  process and handles events
  It only responds to:
  {Owner, enter_world, in, _Room, with, Self}
  … however, what erlmud_conn sends to the new connection erlmud object is:
  Message = {PlayerPid, enter_world, with, ConnObjPid},
  So I’m missing in, _Room
  So, why are the tests passing?
  Do we not count on entering the world?
  Nope, we don’t seem to.
  Ah, we only need that to send messages to the player:
  When we do send the connection erlmud object with the Player as the owner
  will subscribe to the message and send the message on success
  Hmm, seems like it’s useless, because even the test socket creates that
  object but the event is not sent properly

  Ugh, my brain is fuzzy.
  So I’m working on getting erlmud playable.
  I can log in.
  I can look.
  When I “look” I see “an empty room” when I _should_ see people in the room.  (as the tests do)
  Why don’t I see anything else?
