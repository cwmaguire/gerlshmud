G.Erl.S.H.M.U.D - Graph of ERLang Stream Handlers Multi-User Dungeon

GERLSHMUD is being mothballed.
I'm splitting it into three parts:
EGRE - a graph rules engine
EGRE_MUD - a MUD engine using EGRE
EGRE_MUD_1 - a reference implementation of MUD rules for EGRE_MUD

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Actually, it's more like a distributed rules engine than stream handlers)

(2023-08-03 ^ this is what kicked off the change: the graph rules engine
 is its own thing: the fact that it's being used for a MUD is incidental.
 A graph rules engine is not usable on its own if it's married to a MUD.)

How it Works (short version):
All MUD elements (rooms, characters, attributes, weapons, spells) are
processes.
Processes live in a graph.
Events propagate through the graph.
Events succeed or fail.
Events can be: generated, resent, failed, passed, subscribed to.

Since every MUD element hears every local event and can modify it all kinds
of logic becomes possible:
- a door can unlock based on a broach that a character is wearing
- time of day can boost chances to cast a spell
- weather can change the rate at which resources like stamina accrue
- A pair of magic boots could prevent a character from dying
- A jungle area can have a miasma that limits a players focus
The beauty of this is that anything can "man-in-the-middle" any event
without any of the original participants needing to know about it. Every
event initiator simply fires the event out into the world and sees what,
if anything, comes back.

How it Works in Detail:

GERLSHMUD is a graph of asynchronous processes representing every aspect
of a game world: rooms, spells, attributes, attacks, players, etc. Events
in the MUD flow through the graph and touch one process at a time.
Each process takes in events, modifies it's internal state and either
passes on the event or triggers one or more new events.

Any event in the MUD is first proposed as an attempt. Attempts are passed
from process to process through the graph.  Each process can either fail the
attempt with a reason or allow the attempt to succeed. Each process can also
subscribe to the event to be notified of the result. Processes can also resend
a different attempt in place of an original or pass on a modified copy of the
original.

Events in the MUD flow through the process graph without locking up the world.
Each process that handles the event will handle it independently of all other
processes. A process always has the only copy of the event and no locks are
needed. No process will halt processing to communicate with another process.
This means that all information about each event must be contained in the event
itself.

Since processes do not communicate directly, and since all processes
receive all (nearby) events, any process can be added anywhere in the
graph and begin to participate in every (nearby) event. Each process
listens for particluar events and so processes that cooperate to resolve
an event will need to agree on a protocol to communicate via the process
graph.

Example:

A player types "go north".

We're immediately missing information:
Who's going north?
Where are they now?
What is north from there?
Can that character move north?
Is there a north?
Is there free travel to the north?

Eventually every process within reach will see this message.

The player's character process, C, knows that it is "in" room R1. Character C
resends the message as "C move north from R1".

The current message is abandoned. There is now a new message.

An exit process, E, which knows about room R1 also knows that room R1 connects
to room R2 to the north. E drops "north" since it's redundant and resends
"P move from R1 to R2".

The current message is abandoned. There is now a new message.

Exit E or room R2 might see the message "go north" and ignore it before C updates
the message. The "graph traversal" must restart after the message is updated by
C to make sure that every process sees the most recent message. Once the new
message arrives with "P move north from R1" then Exit E will recognize it.

This goes on until the event has all the questions about it answered and either
the message is deemed a success or the message is deemed a failure.

If the door to the north is locked then exit E might fail the message with
"The door to the north is locked."

The rooms, R1 and R2 will subscribe to the message because each will need to update
their properties: R1 will remove C and R2 will add C.

Why go to all this trouble to have a single object handle a single event at
a time? Concurrency and parallelism. If an object can handle a message atomically
then we get several benefits:

a) The objects don't need to be on the same machine. A character can live on
machine A while a room is on machine B. Erlang makes it a cinch to send the
messages to different machines.

b) Every object could potentially be handling a different message at the same time.
Rather than lock up hundreds of processes to reconcile a battle between multiple
characters many events can be happening at the same time.

c) No event is ever modified by two processes at once. No process needs to acquire
any locks which means no deadlocks and no race conditions.

There are downsides though: we have no "transactions" to make sure that information
is still valid by the time it is acted upon. A player might decide to go north
while a door is unlocked but by the time they actually move the door is locked.
In a banking environment this would be a catastrophe but in a MUD this is
survivable. For one, events won't take long to complete. For another, the world
won't end if a player manages to slip through a door milliseconds after the door
is locked. Maybe one day there will be a Games Done Quick feature where this is
abused. I hope so.

Finally, this is all experimental. If it fails, oh well. :)

How to run the tests: (Which is all I've been doing lately)

./t

or with a test case:

./t look_player

How to run it:

make && make rel && _rel/erlmud_release/bin/erlmud_release console
> erlmud_world:init(). %% Loads the world
> erlmud_world:m(s).   %% Move player1 south
> erlmud_world:s().    %% Get the pid and state of all the objects
> erlmud_world:t().    %% Trace erlmud_object and erlmud_exit
> open http://localhost:8080/websocket.html in a browser
> in the browser enter any text for the login
> in the browser enter any text for the password
> start typing commands (e.g. "n", "look", "look pete")
